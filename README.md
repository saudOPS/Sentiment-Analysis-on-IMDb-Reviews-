# Sentiment-Analysis-on-IMDb-Reviews-
Deep Learning vs Classical ML

. Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, NLP, Matplotlib

. Designed and implemented two models — LSTM neural network and Multinomial Naive Bayes — for binary sentiment classification of IMDb movie reviews.

. Processed and cleaned over 50K reviews using tokenization, sequence padding, and bag-of-words representation.

. Achieved 89% accuracy using LSTM and 85% using Naive Bayes, demonstrating the advantage of sequence-aware deep learning models for text analysis.

. Visualized training vs validation accuracy to identify and mitigate overfitting.
